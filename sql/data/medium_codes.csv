WS,Surface water,"Water on the surface of the Earth stored or transported in rivers, streams, estuaries, lakes, ponds, swamps, glaciers, or other aquatic areas. It also may refer to water in urban drains and storm-sewer systems.",9
WG,Groundwater,Water below the surface of the Earth contained in the saturated zone. It does not include soil moisture or interstitial water.,6

WI,Interstitial water,"Water occuring in the small openings, spaces, pores, and voids between particles of unconsolidated materials. Includes water found in the interstices of shallow sediments of a lake, wetland, reservoir, or stream, and in the vadose zone between the root zone and the water table. The water is held in place by entrapment, ionic attraction, and capillary or adhesive forces, rather than from pressure components of saturation.",F
